    Game Rules/Description
  </h3>
  <p>
    Mafia consists of 4 roles: Mafia, Detective, Doctor, and Villager. There will be 1 Mafia, 1 Detective, and 1 Doctor. The rest are villagers.
  <br>
  <br>
    Every night:
  <ul>
    <li>
    The Mafia chooses one player to kill.
    </li>
  <br>
    <li>
    The Detective chooses one person they suspect is the Mafia.
    </li>
  <br>
    <li>
    The Doctor tries to save one person from the Mafia.
    </li>
  </ul>
    During the day, people can discuss and accuse who they think the Mafia is.
    This cycle continues until the Mafia is eliminated or the Mafia kills everyone except one.
